This is a personal collection of low-level network programming examples in Go, focusing on understanding the fundamentals of TCP/IP, UDP, sockets, and packet handling.

> ⚠️ **Important Note**:  
> This repository is for **educational purposes only**. It demonstrates how basic network protocols work at the code level — not how to attack systems.  
> **Do not use any code here to target, flood, or disrupt any service, device, or network without explicit authorization.**

## Topics Covered
- Raw socket basics (where supported)
- UDP/TCP client implementations
- Packet structure exploration
- Timing and connection handling
- Error handling in network code

## Goal
To deepen understanding of how network communication works under the hood — so we can build better, safer, and more resilient systems.

## Legal & Ethical Use
All code is meant to be run in controlled environments:
- Local loopback (`127.0.0.1`)
- Virtual machines
- Lab networks with permission

Using this code to attack systems is:
❌ Illegal  
❌ Unethical  
❌ Harmful  

Study the protocols — don’t abuse them.
